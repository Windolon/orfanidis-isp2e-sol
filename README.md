# orfanidis-isp2e-sol

This is a custom solutions manual to Sophocles J. Orfanidis'
*Introduction to Signal Processing, 2/e (2023)*, as a way to both reinforce
what I have learnt after each chapter and to practise LaTeX typesetting. The
book can be found [here](https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/).

**In no way** is this manual comprehensive like what the
[original author has provided](https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/solutions.zip).
This is merely done for my personal consolidation.
Each person has their own approach to the problems, and this custom
manual may provide just a unique way of logical thinking
to them.

As the solutions manual is made freely available by the author himself,
this little personal project should not encourage so-called "cheating".
