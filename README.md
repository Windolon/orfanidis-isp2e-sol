# orfanidis-isp2e-sol

This is a custom solutions manual to Sophocles J. Orfanidis'
*Introduction to Signal Processing, 2/e (2023)*, as a way to both reinforce
what I have learnt after each chapter and to practise LaTeX typesetting. The
book can be found [here](https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/2e/).

**In no way** is this manual comprehensive like what the
[original author has provided](https://eceweb1.rutgers.edu/~orfanidi/intro2sp/solutions.zip).
This is merely done for my personal consolidation.
Each person has their own approach to the problems, and this custom
manual may provide just a unique way of logical thinking
to them.

As the solutions manual is made freely available by the author himself,
this little personal project should not encourage so-called "cheating" or
"giving up thinking", as the author himself had published everything already.

## Progress

This manual will likely never reach full completion. [In this file](/TODO.md) completed
parts and what I am working on are listed.

## Building the PDF

The project is built using `latexmk`. I use the
[LaTeX Workshop extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=James-Yu.latex-workshop)
for both writing and compiling. The default
arguments to `latexmk` as provided by the extension are used, with
the exception that `-outdir=../out` for less clutter.
