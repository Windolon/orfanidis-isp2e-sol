\section{Sampling and Reconstruction}

\begin{itemize}

\item[1.1]
The rotating wheel is the analog signal, while observations by
the flashing strobe light is akin to a sampler.

In the first case,
we have a $6$ Hz signal sampled at a frequency $f_s = 8$ Hz. As
$f = 6$ lies outside of the Nyquist interval $[-4,4]$, we obtain
$f_a = 6 \text{ mod } 8 = -2$ Hz, implying that the apparent rotational speed
is $2$ Hz but in the opposite direction.

In the second case, $f_s = 12$ Hz, right at the Nyquist limit.
The wheel "rotates" at an apparent speed of $6$ Hz, but it appears
to be flipping up and down rapidly. The rotation direction could be both ways.

In the cases of $f_s = 16$ or $24$ Hz, $f_s$ is above the Nyquist limit.
It appears to be rotating at $6$ Hz with its direction the same
as the actual wheel.
